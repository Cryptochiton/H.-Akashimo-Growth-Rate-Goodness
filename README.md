# H.-Akashimo-Growth-Rate-Goodness
This project will have involve manually importing a small dataset into a dataframe of raw fluorescence readings of a cell culture of a marine raphidophyte, _Heterosigma akashiwo_. 
These data will then be linearized to create a new dataframe, which will then have the means over time of fluorescence taken. Fluorescence is a proxy for growth in many phytoplankton. The mean linearized fluorescence will then be used to create a graph and line of best fit, whose slope is the growth rate of the culture over time.
